vimpager - less.sh replacement

SYNOPSIS
========

cat some_file | vimpager

DESCRIPTION
===========

A slightly more sophisticated replacement for less.sh that also supports
being set as the PAGER environment variable. Displays man pages,
perldocs and python documentation properly. Works on Linux, Solaris,
FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, OSX, Cygwin and msys. Should work on most
other systems as well.

On GitHub: http://github.com/rkitover/vimpager

To use it as as your PAGER: put these in your ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc

    export PAGER=~/bin/vimpager
    alias less=$PAGER
    alias zless=$PAGER

To use a different vimrc with vimpager, put your settings into a
~/.vimpagerrc or ~/.vim/vimpagerrc or a file pointed to by the
VIMPAGER_RC environment variable.

You can also have a global config file for all users in /etc/vimpagerrc,
users can override it by creating a ~/.vimpagerrc or a
~/.vim/vimpagerrc.

To disable loading plugins, put "set noloadplugins" into a vimpagerrc
file.

You can also switch on the "vimpager" variable in your vimrc to set
alternate settings for vimpager.

Put the following into your .vimrc/vimpagerrc if you want to use
gvim/MacVim for your pager window:

    let vimpager_use_gvim = 1

To pass through text that is smaller than the terminal height (without
highlighting, at present) use this:

    let vimpager_passthrough = 1

To start vim with -X (no x11 connection, a bit faster startup) put the
following into your .vimrc/vimpagerrc:

    let vimpager_disable_x11 = 1

The scroll offset (:help scrolloff), may be specified by placing the
following into your .vimrc/vimpagerrc (default = 5, disable = 0):

    let vimpager_scrolloff = 5

The process tree of vimpager is available in the "vimpager_ptree"
variable, an example usage is as follows:

    if exists("vimpager")
      if exists("vimpager_ptree") && vimpager_ptree[-2] == 'wman'
        set ft=man
      endif
    endif

COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
====================

+ | +G
------

Start at the end of the file, just like less.

-c cmd
------

Run a vim command after opening the file.

CYGWIN NOTES
============

The Cygwin gvim is very buggy, vimpager works correctly with the native
Windows gvim, just put it in your PATH.
