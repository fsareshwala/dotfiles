.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
A slightly more sophisticated replacement for less.sh that also supports
being set as the PAGER environment variable.
Displays man pages, perldocs and python documentation properly.
Works on Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, OSX, Cygwin and msys.
Should work on most other systems as well.
.PP
On GitHub: <http://github.com/rkitover/vimpager>
.PP
To use a different vimrc with vimpager, put your settings into a
~/.vimpagerrc or ~/.vim/vimpagerrc or a file pointed to by the
VIMPAGER_RC environment variable.
.PP
You can also have a global config file for all users in /etc/vimpagerrc,
users can override it by creating a ~/.vimpagerrc or a
~/.vim/vimpagerrc.
.PP
To disable loading plugins, put "set noloadplugins" into a vimpagerrc
file.
.PP
You can also switch on the "vimpager" variable in your vimrc to set
alternate settings for vimpager.
.PP
Put the following into your .vimrc/vimpagerrc if you want to use
gvim/MacVim for your pager window:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
let\ vimpager_use_gvim\ =\ 1
\f[]
.fi
.PP
To pass through text that is smaller than the terminal height (without
highlighting, at present) use this:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
let\ vimpager_passthrough\ =\ 1
\f[]
.fi
.PP
To start vim with -X (no x11 connection, a bit faster startup) put the
following into your .vimrc/vimpagerrc:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
let\ vimpager_disable_x11\ =\ 1
\f[]
.fi
.PP
The scroll offset (:help scrolloff), may be specified by placing the
following into your .vimrc/vimpagerrc (default = 5, disable = 0):
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
let\ vimpager_scrolloff\ =\ 5
\f[]
.fi
.PP
The process tree of vimpager is available in the "vimpager_ptree"
variable, an example usage is as follows:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
if\ exists("vimpager")
\ \ if\ exists("vimpager_ptree")\ &&\ vimpager_ptree[-2]\ ==\ \[aq]wman\[aq]
\ \ \ \ set\ ft=man
\ \ endif
endif
\f[]
.fi
.PP
To disable the use of AnsiEsc.vim to display ANSI colors in the source,
set:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
let\ vimpager_disable_ansiesc\ =\ 1
\f[]
.fi
.PP
see the section "ANSI ESCAPE SEQUENCES AND OVERSTRIKES" for more
details.
.SH COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
.SS + | +G
.PP
Start at the end of the file, just like less.
.SS -c cmd
.PP
Run a vim command after opening the file.
.SH ANSI ESCAPE SEQUENCES AND OVERSTRIKES
.PP
If your source is using ANSI escape codes, the AnsiEsc plugin will be
used to show them, rather than the normal vim highlighting, however read
the caveats below.
If this is not possible, they will be stripped out and normal vim
highlighting will be used instead.
.PP
Overstrikes such as in man pages will always be removed.
.PP
vimpager bundles the
AnsiEsc (http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=4979) plugin
(it is expanded at runtime, there is nothing you have to do to enable
it.)
.PP
However, your vim must have been compiled with the \[aq]conceal\[aq]
feature enabled.
To check, try
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
:echo\ has("conceal")
\f[]
.fi
.PP
if the result is \[aq]1\[aq] you have conceal, if it\[aq]s \[aq]0\[aq]
you do not, and the AnsiEsc plugin will not be enabled.
.PP
If you\[aq]re on a Mac, the system vim does not enable this feature,
install vim from Homebrew.
.PP
To disable the use of AnsiEsc.vim, set:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
let\ vimpager_disable_ansiesc\ =\ 1
\f[]
.fi
.PP
in your .vimrc.
.SH CYGWIN NOTES
.PP
The Cygwin gvim is very buggy, vimpager works correctly with the native
Windows gvim, just put it in your PATH.
