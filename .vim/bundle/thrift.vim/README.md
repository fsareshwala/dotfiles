# thrift.vim #

A thrift syntax plugin for vim. This has been forked from the official
repository for Apache Thrift, however it has been modified so that the user
does not have to make further modifications to their vimrc. The syntax has also
been much improved on over the original, covering much more of the langauge.

## Installation ##

Use your usual plugin manager. I recommend [NeoBundle](https://github.com/Shougo/neobundle.vim)

#### NeoBundle

    NeoBundle 'solarnz/thrift.vim'

#### Vundle

    Bundle 'solarnz/thrift.vim'
